Credits to [Angular 2 Seed Project](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed) for initial project setup.

**Note** this project requires node v4.x.x or higher and npm 2.14.7.

In order to start the seed use:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/joedcueto/app_requestMed_Angular
cd app_requestMed_Angular
# install the project's dependencies
npm install
# watches your files and uses livereload by default
npm start
# api document for the app
npm run docs

# dev build
npm run build.dev
# prod build
npm run build.prod
```
